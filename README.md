# QuantSPR

QuantSPR is a script used to quantify the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) response to the adsorption of neurotransmitters to a sparsely tethered lipid bilayer membrane (stBLM). The code works by calculating the SPR response from the refractive index of the bilayer as more neurotransmitters adsorb. The volume of adsorbed neurotransmitters was measured by neutron reflectometry, and the refractive index was calculated using the Clausius-Mossotti relationship.

Code makes extensive use of the TMM Python library written by Steve Byrnes.
